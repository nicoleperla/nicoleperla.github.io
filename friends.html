				<p> I love my friends! I have some from home and some that I met at UW-Madison, but I love them both equally. My 3 best friends are named Bela, Jill, and Elise. I met Bela when I was 6 years old in preschool. She is stylish, funny, and outgoing, and she loves traveling, fashion, and going out to eat in the city. Jill and I also met when we were young - only 10 years old! She is very outgoing, generous, and caring. Her favorite things to do are meet new people, go on long drives, and sing karaoke. The last friend I mentioned is Elise. I met her my freshman year at UW and we became friends immediately. Elise is very smart, witty, and fun. She loves to go on walks, host parties at her apartament, and play with dogs. </p>

				<p> This is Jill and I at our friends' Christmas party last winter break. The theme was ugly sweaters, so we took a photo together wearing our getups. It was such a fun night!</p>
