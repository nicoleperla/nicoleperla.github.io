				<p> Hello everyone, welcome to my webpage! I am a junior at <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/"> UW-Madison </a> majoring in Information Science and Communication Arts. I have made this webpage for <i>LIS 351:Introduction to Digital Information</i>, which includes a little bit about me and some of my favorite things. Please enjoy taking a look at my site!</p>

				<p style="color:deeppink;">This photo of me and my friend Samir was taken in Puerto Rico over this past spring break. We went with a huge group of 16 of our friends to San Juan and had such an amazing time. It was the first big trip I have ever been on with friends!</p>

				<p style="color:deeppink;">This picture was taken in Old San Juan, the historic site of Puerto Rico that dates back to the 16th century. There were many cathedrals, resturants, jewlery shops, and beautifully painted houses. I miss it already.</p>
