				<p> Food is one thing I am very passionate about. I love all kinds of food, and really enjoy cooking meals for myself, my friends, and my family. I typically like to make things such as pasta, chicken, stir fry, salad, and other tasty meals at home. However, I am a big fan of eating out, especially with all the great food options Madison offers. There is a wide array of cuisines in the city, but some of my favorites include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Asian</li>
					<li>Indian</li>
					<li>Meditteranean</li>
					<li>Italian</li>
					<li>American</li>
				</ul>
		<p><b>I have attached photos of some of the amazing food I've had around campus below</b></p>
