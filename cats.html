				<p> If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I love cats. Dogs can't even compare to the goofy and lovable nature of these creatures. Just take a look at this video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxS5E-kZc2s"> Cute Cats </a> and you will know why I say this. I have had cats my whole life and plan on being a crazy cat lady when I grow up, so I have always made an effort to convert all my friends and family to cat-lovers. I have 2 of my own, named Fonzi and Elvis. My family got them both when they were kittens, but they are now 7 and 8 years old. </p>

				<p> Fonzi is a gentle giant. We adopted him from a cat hoarding house, so he was very shy and anxious when we first met him. However, he broke out of his shell over time and is now a very adventurous outdoor cat. Fonzi <b>LOVES</b> food, naps, and discovering new trees and bushes to hide in around our neighborhood.

				<p> Although they are not related by blood, these boys have spent year together and have become best buds! They love to take naps, groom eachother, and steal eachothers food ;) </p>

				<h2 style="color:deeppink;"> Elvis </h2>
				<img src="elvis.jpg" alt="Elvis" width="180" height="200">
				<p> Elvis is the little daredevil of the family. He has been <b>EXTREMELY</b> outgoing since day 1, and started exploring the outdoors as soon as we got him. But, for as much energy he has, he is a sweet guy who loves to cuddle and play with humans. Elvis' favorite activities are chasing squirrels, nuzzling against people's legs, and eating as many treats as he can.
